My goal is to become a solid C++ programmer and create a project in C++ before end of summer . Currently working in C++ Crash Course by Josh Lespinoso. Will be posting the solutions to the exercises soon.

#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    const char* result_1 = "Good";
    const char* result_2 = "Wtf";
    int book_finished = 45;

    if (book_finished < 45) {
        printf("%s\n", result_1);
    } else {
        printf("%s\n", result_2);
    }

    return 0;
}
